# 🏢 Simple Employee Admin Portal

A RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core for managing employees — supports full CRUD operations with clean architecture using Repository Pattern and Unit of Work.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core Web API** — .NET 8
- **Entity Framework Core** — ORM for database access
- **SQL Server** — Database

## 🏗️ Architecture & Patterns

### Repository Pattern
> "One gate to the database"

A entity has its own repository that is the **only class allowed to talk to the database** — services never access `DbContext` directly.

### Unit of Work
> "All or nothing when saving"

A repository share a single `DbContext` and save  — if one operation fails, nothing is committed.

### Dependency Injection
> "Don't create it, just ask for it"

All services and repositories are registered in `Program.cs` and injected via constructors.

## 💡 Key Concepts Used

| Concept | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `async / await` | Non-blocking DB calls — app stays free while waiting |
| `Task<T>` | Promise to return data later |
| `Guid` | Unique Id for each employee |
| `string?` | Nullable — field is optional |
| `required` | Compiler forces property to be set |
| `IEnumerable<T>` | Return a list of employees |
